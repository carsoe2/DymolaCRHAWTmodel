This paper (located in /report) analyzes the effect of the blade length of a contra-rotating wind turbine on a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine. Implemented on the Dymola 2023x modeling and simulation tool, the contra-rotating wind turbine model utilizes the Dymola Wind Power library produced by Dassault Syst√®mes. The analysis is conducted using a sweep function which runs the simulation through wind speeds that constantly increase over 500 seconds. Each iteration of the sweep function increases the length of the contra-rotating wind turbine as well as its inertia. After the sweep completes a comparison metric variable, the rear rotor power coefficient, and maximum extractable power are compared. The slides for the presentation are located in /presentation.
